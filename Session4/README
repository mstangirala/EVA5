The following are the topics of discussion

MaxPooling,
1x1 Convolutions,
3x3 Convolutions,
Receptive Field,
SoftMax,
Learning Rate,
Kernels and how do we decide the number of kernels?
Batch Normalization,
Image Normalization,
Position of MaxPooling,
Concept of Transition Layers,
Position of Transition Layer,
DropOut
When do we introduce DropOut, or when do we know we have some overfitting
The distance of MaxPooling from Prediction,
The distance of Batch Normalization from Prediction,

Write a network such that it has

99.4% validation accuracy
Less than 20k Parameters
You can use anything from above you want. 
Less than 20 Epochs
No fully connected layer
